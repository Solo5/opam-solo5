Solo5 unikernel base (virtio target)

This package provides the Solo5 base layer to run MirageOS unikernels on the
"virtio" target. Unikernels built for the "virtio" target run directly on
existing hypervisors, such as KVM/QEMU and bhyve.

Additionally, this package installs the "solo5-run-virtio" tool, a wrapper for
launching unikernels on various hypervisors, and the "solo5-mkimage" tool for
building MBR-partitioned disk images with a bootloader and unikernel installed.
The latter includes support for building images suitable for upload to Google
Compute Engine.
